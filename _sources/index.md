```{note}
These lectures were built using the new Sphinx-based [Jupyter Book
2.0](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html) tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).  They are
intended mainly as a demonstration of these tools.
Instructions for how to build them from source can be found in the Jupyter
Book documentation.

# About Neural Networks

In this exciting journey, we'll delve into the fascinating world of **Neural Networks** and **Deep Learning** with Python and Pytorch, where machines learn, adapt, and make decisions based on data. Topics that are covered are optmization, neural networks basics, perceptron model, mulit-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, and advanced topics such as autoencoders and generative adversarial networks.


## Prerequisites

- **Basic Knowledge**: You should have a solid understanding of artificial intelligence concepts.
- **Mathematics**: Advanced topics may require strong mathematical foundations.
- Current students of **MDS** at **FUM University** are acquainted with the concepts covered in the [**FDS Course**](https://fum-cs.github.io/fds/)


## Questions?
I will be having office hours for this course on Monday (10:00 AM--11:30 AM). If this is not convenient, email me at m.amintoosi@um.ac.ir, talk to me after class or [schedule an appointment via Calendly](https://calendly.com/m-amintoosi/30min).

I should mention that the original material was from [Tomas Beuzen's course](https://ubc-mds.github.io/DSCI_572_sup-learn-2). I have forked his repository and modified it to suit my own needs andpreferences. I would like to thank him for his great work and generosity.
