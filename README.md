### Labs and Quizzes

You are responsible for the following deliverables, which will determine your course grade:

| Assessment       | Weight |
|------------------|--------|
| Lab Assignment 1 | 15%    |
| Lab Assignment 2 | 15%    |
| Quiz 1           | 20%    |
| Lab Assignment 3 | 15%    |
| Lab Assignment 4 | 15%    |
| Quiz 2           | 20%    |

Labs are Jupyter notebooks comprised of more comprehensive exercises aimed at demonstrating and reinforcing concepts learned during lectures. Quizzes will be conducted on Canvas in week 3 and week 5, are open book and are typically 40 mins long with a focus on short-answer questions. More information on quizzes will be provided closer to their dates.
